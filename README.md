The Farmart Sales Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage sales, inventory, and customer data for a farm equipment store. The system keeps track of purchases, leases, and services offered by the store, recording transactions in a MySQL database. It generates invoices, calculates taxes, and tracks the storeâ€™s profit and loss based on the items and services sold. Additionally, the project utilizes object-oriented programming principles and relational database management to ensure efficient data handling and reporting. The system also includes features like CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing data, and custom sorting algorithms to generate reports for different sales metrics.
